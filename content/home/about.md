Welcome to the TreeTop Project

I'm proud to share where we are with this.  Today we have our first TreeTop Case, the "TreeTop Prototyper".

This case is made nearly entirely of wood.  As you can see above by the photos the only non-wood parts are;

- Raspberry Pi 4
- Raspberry Pi 7" display
- Screws holding the male to female plugs
- Keyboard

This is a working prototype itself and is likely to go through a few revisions.

We were inspired by the following projects;

- [The ultimate typewriter](https://alternativebit.fr/posts/ultimate-writer/)
- [Pi-Top](https://www.cnet.com/news/pi-top-the-3d-printable-raspberry-pi-laptop-anyone-can-build/)

## Why did you start this project?

I really wanted a Pi-Top, but with the [Raspberry 4](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) 
being released I wanted to try my hand at running one of these as a desktop unit.  However these Raspberry Pi's
are such a mess of cables.  Sure there's way you can manage that, but I didn't want that.  I wanted something nice.

I also really loved the idea of prototyping in the case and being able to close it up when I was done without disassembly.

That's what drove this project.  I reached out to the Pi-Top people about the supposedly 3d printable models they 
we're supposed to release but they always replied that it is in the works.  It's been 3+ years, I doubt we'll ever see them.

With that being said.  I learned a lot from this project and if this is something others are interested in, I plan to
make these plans available in some form eventually or at least a buyable way to get this case to you.
